# Exploring Transformers for Urban Air Quality Inference

This repository contains the work completed during the Machine Learning course [ES654] under the instruction of Prof. Nipun Batra at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar.

### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to infer urban air quality using machine learning techniques. The study focused on preprocessing and analyzing fine-grained air quality data from four Chinese cities, aiming to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) at various locations based on multiple environmental factors such as humidity and temperature.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The air quality datasets were rigorously cleaned and structured to prepare them for effective machine learning model training and validation.
- **Model Implementation and Comparison:** Several machine learning models were applied to the preprocessed data to assess their performance in predicting air quality. The models' effectiveness was compared.
- **Advanced Modeling with Transformers:** A transformers-based model was implemented to handle sequential data for making time-sensitive predictions of the AQI. 

The project was a result of collaborative effort of five students at IIT Gandhinagar.
1. Hitarth Gandhi, Discipline of Computer Science and Engineering
2. Ishan Prayagi, Discipline of Mechanical Engineering
3. Somesh Pratap Singh, Discipline of Mechanical Engineering & Computer Science and Engineering
4. Vishal Soni, Discipline of Computer Science and Engineering
5. Xhitij Choudhary, Discipline of Chemical Engineering

We would like to thank Prof. Nipun Batra and the TAs, Harsh Patel and Palak Purohit for guiding us throughout the project and providing us with all the assistance needed.
